            Agricart Farmers Producer Company Limited &reg;, registered in 2019, is working with 500 farmers and traditional seed savers in District Sindhudurg of State Maharashtra. The prime motive of the Farmer Organisation is to conserve traditional seeds, farm practices, recipes, and other traditional knowledge through public participation in a sustainable way. The organisation ensures direct monetary benefits to the farmers, encouraging them to conserve their precious traditional knowledge.
            <br /><br />
            The conceptualization and execution of the idea of this company were part of two independent projects. In 2018, Mr. Sachin Chorge and his fellow farmers were working on the Maharashtra Gene Bank project under the guidance of Sanjay Patil of BAIF Institute, Pune, and Vasundhara Science Centre, Nerurpar. Through this project, 40 traditional rice varieties and 26 other crops and vegetable seeds of Sindhudurg were collected and conserved. Another project was started at the same time by NABARD and Lupin Foundation to help set up farmer producer organizations in Sindhudurg. LUPIN Foundation was already working with these farmers on different agricultural projects and decided to involve them in the Producer Company. AGRICART FPC came into existence in 2018, and the work of conservation &amp; livelihood generation was supported with financial capacity. Since then, the company has been growing its business in local food, articles, and services along with its local crop variety conservation mission.
